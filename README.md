## 👋🏻 Hey, I'm Rohit 

20-year-old full-stack developer who's spent more time talking to LLMs and APIs than actual people.

I write JavaScript that pretends to be TypeScript, and TypeScript that pretends to be safe.
My PRs are clean, my Git commits are poetic lies (`fix: totally fixed it this time`), and yes — I do believe `any` is a valid type when the deadline is in 5 minutes.

---

### 🛠️ I Work With:

* **Next.js** — for SSR, CSR, ISR, and every other acronym I had to Google again
* **tRPC + Zod** — so TypeScript can yell at me twice as much
* **Prisma** and **Drizzle** — because I like my databases ORMantic 💔
* **Tailwind CSS** — because I’m too lazy to name classes that make sense
* **Node.js** — where async bugs go to retire
* **OpenAI / Gemini APIs** — so users can talk to a bot instead of opening a ticket

---

### 🧠 Brain Stack:

* I name my components after what I wish they did
* I document my code the same way archaeologists label fossils: with wild guesses
* Knows exactly when to `npm install` and when to delete `node_modules` and pray
* Currently refactoring a project I haven’t even finished writing yet
* Writes `TODO: fix this later` like I have a later  
* Types `npm run dev` faster than I type my own name

---

### ⚠️ Warning:

* Might refactor your codebase at 2AM because "it felt off"
* Will introduce AI to a project that never asked for it

Let’s ship weird things, crash some builds, and push to main like rebels.
