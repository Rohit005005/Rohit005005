## 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Rohit.


I am a software developer focused on building scalable, type-safe applications for the modern web. I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and responsive, intuitive user interfaces.

My strength lies in my versatility: I am as comfortable configuring Linux environments and writing server-side logic as I am crafting pixel-perfect frontend experiences. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Backend Systems** to solve challenging engineering problems.

### 🛠 Technical Stack

**Frontend**
* **React & Next.js:** Building production-grade SSR and CSR applications with a focus on performance and SEO.
* **TypeScript:** Implementing strict static typing for maintainable, bug-free codebases.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Implementing responsive, scalable design systems.

**Backend & Database**
* **Node.js:** Extensive experience with server-side JavaScript/TypeScript.
* **Databases:** Proficient with **MongoDB** for flexible document storage, and **PostgreSQL** (via **Prisma** / **Drizzle**) for relational data handling.
* **Zod:** Implementing strict runtime schema validation for data integrity.

**System & Tools**
* **Linux (Fedora):** Advanced user proficient in shell scripting, system configuration, and CLI tool development.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control, branching strategies, and collaborative development.
* **API Integration:** Experience implementing LLMs (OpenAI/Gemini) and RESTful services.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On

* **Expanding to Mobile:** Translating my web development knowledge to mobile apps using **React Native** and **Expo**.
* **System Tooling:** Developing custom CLI tools using Node.js to optimize developer workflows on Linux.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Exploring diverse database strategies, from ORM-managed SQL to flexible NoSQL schemas with MongoDB.
